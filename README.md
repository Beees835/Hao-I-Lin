# Hao-I-Lin

Hello, I'm Hao-I Lin (Benson). My academic journey, marked by expertise in computer science, has fueled my passion for technology and problem-solving. I thrive in environments where I can apply my analytical skills and my love for organizing and simplifying complex tasks. 

My interest in technology extends beyond personal enjoyment; I am deeply committed to using my skills to make a positive impact in the world of cybersecurity. Although I am at the beginning of my professional journey, my drive and thirst for knowledge are the cornerstones of my aspiration to become a cybersecurity analyst.

I am particularly drawn to the idea of protecting individuals' security, including their financial well-being. In a world increasingly reliant on digital platforms, I see this as an opportunity to contribute meaningfully to society's safety and security. I am currently pursuing the Google Cybersecurity Certificate, a step I believe is crucial in honing the professional skills I need to excel in this field.

As an entry-level candidate, I am eager to immerse myself in the cybersecurity domain, where I can blend my analytical abilities with my passion for technology to develop innovative solutions to complex security challenges. I am excited about the prospect of joining a team where I can contribute, learn, and grow while making a tangible difference in safeguarding digital information and assets.
